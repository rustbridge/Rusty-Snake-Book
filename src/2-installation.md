For these platforms, it is recommended to use the [Official Rust Installation Process](https://rustup.rs/) via `rustup.rs`. When asked, the default settings (including the `stable` compiler) are suitable for this course.

This will process will install a number of tools required for this course, including `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.
